This demonstrates how simple gates (digital and "quantum") can control web crawlers decision mechanism / visualization.

This is a sample web crawler that uses XOR and CNOT for controlling a web crawler.

1. Class Initialization:
   - The `XOR_CNOT_OUTCrawler` class is initialized with a starting URL, maximum crawl depth, and grid size.
   - It sets up a grid (default 5x5) representing the "lights", all initially off (0).
   - A `current_position` is initialized at [0, 0] (top-left corner).

2. Crawling Process:
   - The `crawl` method starts the process by displaying the initial dark grid and then calls `recursive_crawl`.
   - `recursive_crawl` is the main engine of the crawler:
     - It checks if the current depth exceeds the max depth or if the URL has been visited.
     - It marks the URL as visited and attempts to fetch the webpage.
     - It extracts valid links from the page for further crawling.
     - It calls `update_grid` to process the page content.
     - It recursively calls itself for each new valid link.

3. Grid Update Process:
   - `update_grid` is called for each crawled page:
     - It lights up (sets to 1) the current position on the grid.
     - It randomly chooses between XOR and CNOT-like operations.
     - It calls either `xor_operation` or `cnot_operation`.
     - It moves to the next position on the grid.

4. XOR Operation:
   - `xor_operation` processes the entire grid based on the page content:
     - For each grid cell, it checks a corresponding section of the page content.
     - If any character in that section has an odd ASCII value, it toggles (XORs) the corresponding grid cell.

5. CNOT-like Operation:
   - `cnot_operation` simulates a quantum CNOT gate:
     - It uses the current position as the control qubit.
     - It randomly selects another position as the target qubit.
     - If the control qubit is 1 (lit), it flips the state of the target qubit.

6. Grid Navigation:
   - `move_position` updates the `current_position`:
     - It moves from left to right, then top to bottom.
     - When it reaches the end of the grid, it wraps back to the top-left corner.

7. Visualization:
   - `display_grid` shows the current state of the grid:
     - It uses '○' for lit cells (1) and '●' for dark cells (0).
     - The grid is displayed after each operation to visualize changes.

8. Error Handling:
   - The code includes basic error handling to catch and report any issues during the crawling process.

9. Timing and User Experience:
   - Short pauses (`time.sleep()`) are added between operations to make the visualization easier to follow.

This code creates a unique visualization of web crawling, where each visited page affects a grid of "lights" through operations inspired by quantum computing concepts. It combines web scraping techniques with elements of the Lights Out puzzle and quantum gates, creating an engaging and visually interesting representation of the crawling process.
